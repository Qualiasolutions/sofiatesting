📌 Template 26: Multiple Areas Issue

**Purpose**: Handle 'Multiple Areas Issue' communication exactly as per template.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Client's Name (e.g., Svetlana Ivanova)
- City/Region (e.g., Cyprus)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year is missing automatically assume the upcoming occurrence (NEVER ask for the year); if time is missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**). Nothing else.
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Use personalized greeting `Dear [Client's Name],` where shown.

🔹 Exact Template
Template 10: Multiple Areas Issue

Required Fields:

Client's Name (e.g., Svetlana Ivanova)

City/Region (e.g., Cyprus)

Subject: Adjustments required for areas of interest – [Client's Name]

Dear [Client's Name],

We hope this email finds you well. We appreciate your interest in our estate agency and your request to view properties in different areas in [City/Region].

However, we regret to inform you that your request to view properties in multiple areas is not feasible due to the resources and time required for such extensive coverage.

To optimize the search process, we kindly request your assistance in narrowing down your property search to fewer areas. As you may know, [City/Region] offers a wide range of diverse neighborhoods and locations. By narrowing down your search, we can ensure that we are fully focused on finding the most suitable options for you.

If you are open to adjusting your request to fewer areas, please let us know and we will be more than happy to assist you further. If, however, this is not possible, we regretfully won't be able to facilitate your request at this time.

We appreciate your understanding and we remain committed to providing you with the best possible service within our operational capabilities.

We look forward to hearing from you and assisting you with your property search.

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

🔹 Common Mistakes
❌ Wrong		✅ Correct
Bolding subject lines	No bolding except pricing/fees
Using personalized greeting when placeholder is required	Use `Dear XXXXXXXX,` unless template says otherwise
Generating with [FIELD] placeholders left	Ask for missing fields, then generate with no placeholders

🔹 Example Output
Subject: Adjustments required for areas of interest – [Client's Name]

Email Body:

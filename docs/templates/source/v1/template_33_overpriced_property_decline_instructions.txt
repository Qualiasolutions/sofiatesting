**Purpose**: Handle 'Overpriced Property Decline' communication exactly as per template.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Seller's Name (e.g., Marios Charalambous)
- Transaction Type (e.g., sale or rent)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year is missing automatically assume the upcoming occurrence (NEVER ask for the year); if time is missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5%+ VAT**). Nothing else.
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Use personalized greeting `Dear [Client's Name],` where shown.

Thank you for considering us to market your property.

However, after carefully evaluating your property with the expertise of our team, in our opinion, we regret to inform you that the asking price you provided is significantly above the current market value. As a result, we are unable to effectively market and introduce your property at this price.

We understand that setting a realistic asking price is essential for a successful [sale/rent], and we would be delighted to assist you in determining a price that reflects current market conditions.

Should you wish to discuss further, please do not hesitate to contact us — we would be glad to explore with you the available options for marketing, adjusting the asking price, and ultimately achieving the [sale/rent] of your property.

Thank you for your understanding, and we remain at your disposal.

2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).

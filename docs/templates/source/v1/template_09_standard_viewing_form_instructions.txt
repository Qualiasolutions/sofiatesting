👁️ VIEWING FORM & RESERVATION TEMPLATES (5 Types)
Standard Viewing Form
Viewing Form

**Date:** [DATE]

Herein, I…………………………………………………………… with ID……………………. Issued By: confirm that CSC Zyprus Property Group LTD (Reg. No. 742, Lic. No. 378/E), has introduced to me with a viewing the property with the following Registry details

**Registration No.:** [REGISTRATION_NO]

**District:** [DISTRICT]

**Municipality:** [MUNICIPALITY]

**Locality:** [LOCALITY]

**Signature:** _________________________

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

🔹 Common Mistakes
❌ Wrong		✅ Correct
Bolding subject lines	No bolding except pricing/fees
Using personalized greeting when placeholder is required	Use `Dear XXXXXXXX,` unless template says otherwise
Generating with [FIELD] placeholders left	Ask for missing fields, then generate with no placeholders

🔹 Example Output
User Input: "Viewing form for John Smith, Reg No. 0/1789, Tala, Paphos, today."
Generated Document:
Standard Viewing Form
...

💡 Pro Tips
- Use L.N. 378/E format only in multiple-persons form.
- If locality unknown, leave blank—do not invent.

📌 Template 34: Property Location Information Request

**Purpose**: Handle 'Property Location Information Request' communication exactly as per template.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Client's Name (e.g., Andreas Andreou)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year is missing automatically assume the upcoming occurrence (NEVER ask for the year); if time is missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**). Nothing else.
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Use personalized greeting `Dear [Client's Name],` where shown.

🔹 Exact Template
Template 18: Property Location Information Request

Required Fields:

Client's Name (e.g., Andreas Andreou)

Subject: Property information – [Client's Name]

Dear [Client's Name],

Thank you for expressing interest in the property listed with our estate agency. We appreciate your inquiry and would like to provide you with some important information.

As a standard practice, we do not disclose the exact location or address of the property prior to a scheduled viewing and/or completion of our registration process.

This practice is in place to protect the interests of all parties involved and to ensure that our agency's commission is duly respected.

We understand that you may have questions about the property's location but we are unable to disclose that information without taking the necessary steps. We value your interest in the property and would be happy to arrange a phone communication at your convenience.

Please let us know your preferred date and time for a phone call. To make scheduling easier, it would be helpful if you could provide two time/date options that work best for you.

This will enable us to discuss your property requirements in detail and provide you with personalized assistance in finding the right property.

We look forward to hearing from you and assisting you with your property search.

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

🔹 Common Mistakes
❌ Wrong		✅ Correct
Bolding subject lines	No bolding except pricing/fees
Using personalized greeting when placeholder is required	Use `Dear XXXXXXXX,` unless template says otherwise
Generating with [FIELD] placeholders left	Ask for missing fields, then generate with no placeholders

🔹 Example Output

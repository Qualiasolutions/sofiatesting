📌 Template 30: AML/KYC Record Keeping Procedure

**Purpose**: Handle 'AML/KYC Record Keeping Procedure' communication exactly as per template.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Invoice Number (e.g., INV-2025-123)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year is missing automatically assume the upcoming occurrence (NEVER ask for the year); if time is missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**). Nothing else.
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Use personalized greeting `Dear [Client's Name],` where shown.

🔹 Exact Template
Template 14: AML/KYC Record Keeping Procedure

Required Fields:

Invoice Number (e.g., INV-2025-123)

📩 Subject: AML/KYC Record Keeping – Procedure for New Cases

Email Body:

Dear colleagues,

From now on, for every new case, please make sure to request from the lawyer handling the transaction a PDF file containing the key documents of the case. This file should include at least the Sales Agreement.

➡️ This document should be sent to us as a copy, as we are directly involved in the transaction, and according to Law 188(I)/2007, we are also legally required to maintain AML/KYC records for our clients — just like the lawyers are.

📌 If a lawyer asks why you are requesting it, you can kindly explain that:

• It is also a legal obligation for us, not only for them

• Since we are involved in the transaction, we are required to keep this documentation on file

• No one will refuse this request — it is reasonable and fully in line with the legislation

📁 In practice, most lawyers already have these files prepared in PDF format, so there is minimal effort involved in forwarding them to us.

✅ Even if the full AML/KYC file is not available, the Sales Agreement is a minimum requirement and must be obtained.

🧾 Final sending procedure:

Once you have:

• The PDF file from the lawyer

• And our invoice. Our invoice number is important since we relate each case based on our invoice reference no.

📤 Please send them both as attachments via email to:

📧 compliance@zyprus.com

Subject: Case Invoice No [INVOICE NUMBER]

➕ The first time you send documents for each case, please cc me as well (for a basic review).

💬 Why this is important:

• It fully covers us in the event of an AML or tax audit

• It avoids the need to ask you for documents later

• In some cases, the bank may require a copy of the Sales Agreement in order to release our commission payment — so having it in advance speeds up your payment.

Thank you for following this simple but important procedure.

Additional Note: KYC for Bank Sales (Gordian/Remu/Altamira)

Regarding the KYC PDF document we discussed: for Gordian/Remu/Altamira

(a) Way | Since banks usually don't provide the KYC PDF easily, to avoid complications, it's best to connect the bank or fund directly with your client and be included in the email communication. This way, you'll receive the necessary information and can forward it to the Zyprus compliance email compliance@zyprus.com as needed, without needing formal approval from the bank.

(b) Way | Also, if you pass the case to a lawyer, you can request the details from the lawyer representing the buyer or your client—this helps you bypass the bank's bureaucracy.

(c) Way | Worst case scenario, you can ask the client to provide if possible.

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

🔹 Common Mistakes
❌ Wrong		✅ Correct
Bolding subject lines	No bolding except pricing/fees
Using personalized greeting when placeholder is required	Use `Dear XXXXXXXX,` unless template says otherwise
Generating with [FIELD] placeholders left	Ask for missing fields, then generate with no placeholders

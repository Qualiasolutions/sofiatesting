📌 Template 28: Still Looking Follow-up

**Purpose**: Handle 'Still Looking Follow-up' communication exactly as per template.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Client's Name (e.g., Olivia Chen)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year is missing automatically assume the upcoming occurrence (NEVER ask for the year); if time is missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**). Nothing else.
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Use personalized greeting `Dear [Client's Name],` where shown.

(Note: Use "message" instead of "email" if for WhatsApp)

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

🔹 Common Mistakes
❌ Wrong		✅ Correct
Bolding subject lines	No bolding except pricing/fees
Using personalized greeting when placeholder is required	Use `Dear XXXXXXXX,` unless template says otherwise
Generating with [FIELD] placeholders left	Ask for missing fields, then generate with no placeholders

🔹 Example Output
Subject: Following up on your Property Search – [Client's Name]

Email Body:
(Example body per exact template...)

💡 Pro Tips
- Keep tone professional and concise.
- Follow subject format exactly if specified.

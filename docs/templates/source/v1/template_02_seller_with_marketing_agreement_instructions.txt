Omitting the direct communication clause	Always include unless user asks to remove
Bolding the fees section	No bolding (only bold monetary values, e.g., €500; not text)
Generating with [VIEWING_DATETIME] placeholder	Ask for missing time/year first
Adding "Let me know if you need changes"	Only output the final email

💡 Pro Tips for the Agent
Multiple Buyers: If names include "&", "and", or "couple", the template automatically covers joint liability.
Project vs. Reg No.:
For developed properties (e.g., apartments in a complex), use: Unit No. [X] at [Project Name], [Location].
For standalone properties, use: Registration No. [REG_NUMBER] [Location].
Direct Communication Clause:
Never remove unless the user explicitly requests it.
If removed, only delete the clause, not the fees section.
Urgent Requests: Generate immediately once all fields are confirmed. No delays or "double-checking."

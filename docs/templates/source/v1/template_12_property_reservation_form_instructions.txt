📌 Template 12: Property Reservation Form

**Purpose**: Create a simple reservation record with fee terms.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Date Reservation Fee Received (e.g., October 25, 2025)
- Prospective Buyer(s) (e.g., Alex & Maria)
- Vendor(s) (e.g., Mr. and Mrs. Ioannou)
- Property Details (e.g., Apartment 302, Limassol)
- Reservation Fee (e.g., €10,000 and words)
- Purchase Price (e.g., €350,000 and words)
- Special Conditions (e.g., Optional notes)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year is missing automatically assume the upcoming occurrence (NEVER ask for the year); if time is missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**). Nothing else.
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Bold **€** amounts only; keep wording intact.
- Include 40-day validity note verbatim.

🔹 Exact Template
Property Reservation Form

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

🔹 Common Mistakes
❌ Wrong		✅ Correct
Bolding subject lines	No bolding except pricing/fees
Using personalized greeting when placeholder is required	Use `Dear XXXXXXXX,` unless template says otherwise
Generating with [FIELD] placeholders left	Ask for missing fields, then generate with no placeholders

🔹 Example Output
User Input: "Reservation €10,000 on Apt 302; price €350,000."
Generated Document:
PROPERTY RESERVATION ...

💡 Pro Tips
- Return conditions must match template.
- Price in words must match numerals.

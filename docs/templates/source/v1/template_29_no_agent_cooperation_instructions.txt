📌 Template 29: No Agent Cooperation

**Purpose**: Handle 'No Agent Cooperation' communication exactly as per template.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Estate Agent's Name (e.g., Andreas from ABC Realty)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year is missing automatically assume the upcoming occurrence (NEVER ask for the year); if time is missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**). Nothing else.
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Use personalized greeting `Dear [Client's Name],` where shown.

🔹 Exact Template
Template 13: No Agent Cooperation

Required Fields:

Dear [Estate Agent's Name],

Thank you for your cooperation inquiry. We genuinely appreciate your interest in establishing a working relationship.

At this time, however, our focus is exclusively on serving direct clients, and due to our current business priorities, we cannot take on cooperative ventures.

Should our circumstances change in the future, we will gladly keep your contact information on file for potential collaboration.

Thank you for your understanding, and we wish you continued success in all your endeavors within the industry.

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

🔹 Common Mistakes
❌ Wrong		✅ Correct
Bolding subject lines	No bolding except pricing/fees
Using personalized greeting when placeholder is required	Use `Dear XXXXXXXX,` unless template says otherwise
Generating with [FIELD] placeholders left	Ask for missing fields, then generate with no placeholders

📌 Template 04: Advanced Seller Registration

**Purpose**: Provide a comprehensive seller registration including multiple reg numbers, fees, and terms.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Buyer Names (e.g., Maria & George Papadopoulos)
- Location (e.g., Limassol)
- Registration Numbers (e.g., 0/1234, 0/5678)
- Property Description (e.g., Two adjacent plots on Agiou Neophytou)
- Agency Fee (e.g., 5.0)
- Payment Percentage (e.g., 30)
- Owner Entities (e.g., Company ABC Ltd and Mr. X)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year is missing automatically assume the upcoming occurrence (NEVER ask for the year); if time is missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**). Nothing else.
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Include agency fee as **[AGENCY_FEE]% + VAT**; bolding applies only to numbers/percentages.
- Ensure 'owner entities' are included verbatim as provided.

🔹 Exact Template
Template 04: Advanced Seller Registration

Subject: Registration – [BUYER_NAMES] – Reg. Nos. [REG_NUMBERS] – [PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION]

Email Body:

Dear XXXXXXXX,

This email is to provide you with the full registration of our below client, under our Estate Agency: CSC Zyprus Property Group LTD.

**Client Information:** [BUYER_NAMES] and any directly related company in which [he/she/they] is/are a sole shareholder or co-shareholder.

**Property Introduced:** Your property in [LOCATION], with the following Registration Numbers: [REG_NUMBERS] ([PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION])

Our Agency **Fees:** [AGENCY_FEE]% + VAT based on the final agreed sold price. If sold to the above-mentioned purchaser introduced to you by CSC Zyprus Property Group LTD.

Our fee becomes payable in full upon your receipt of the initial [PAYMENT_PERCENTAGE]% payment of the agreed purchase price. This ensures that, in cases where the remaining balance may be delayed due to the issuance of title deeds, licenses, or any other special agreement reached with the buyer/client, our agency is not required to wait indefinitely for settlement. This method of payment is consistent with standard market practice in similar transactions.

Acceptance of registration implies a full registration under our agency regardless of viewing arrangement(s) by our firm, since your property details will be fully provided for enhanced and transparent review by our client. Acceptance of registration also implies acceptance of the above fees and terms.

Looking forward to your prompt reply.

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

🔹 Common Mistakes
❌ Wrong		✅ Correct
Bolding subject lines	No bolding except pricing/fees
Using personalized greeting when placeholder is required	Use `Dear XXXXXXXX,` unless template says otherwise
Generating with [FIELD] placeholders left	Ask for missing fields, then generate with no placeholders

🔹 Example Output
Subject: Registration – Maria & George Papadopoulos – Reg. Nos. 0/1234, 0/5678 – Two adjacent plots in Limassol

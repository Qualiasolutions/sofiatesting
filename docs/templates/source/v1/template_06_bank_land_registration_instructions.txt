📌 Template 06: Bank Land Registration

**Purpose**: Register a client with a bank for a LAND plot and include the viewing form attachment reminder.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Bank Name (e.g., Gordian, REMU, Altamira, Bank of Cyprus, Hellenic Bank)
- Client Name (e.g., Elena Petrou)
- Client Phone (full format) (e.g., +357 96 111222)
- Agent Mobile (e.g., +357 99 998877)
- Property Link (MANDATORY - e.g., https://www.gogordian.com/listing/12345)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting must be `Dear [BANK_NAME] Team,`
- Property link is **MANDATORY** - do not generate without it
- Mask client phone in the body (e.g., +357 96**1222 - only mask 3rd & 4th digits)
- Subject line: No bolding
- Body: Only bold the field labels (My Mobile:, Registration Details:, Property:)
- **MUST include** the viewing form attachment reminder at the end
- This template is ONLY for LAND - not for houses/apartments (use Template 05 for those)

🔹 Phone Masking Rules
Full phone: +357 96111222
Masked: +357 96**1222
Pattern: First 2 digits + ** (mask 3rd & 4th) + last 4 digits
Example: +357 97935841 → +357 97**5841
ONLY MASK 2 DIGITS (the 3rd and 4th) - NOT MORE!

🔹 Why Land is Different
Banks do NOT attend viewings for land plots. The agent must:
1. Conduct the viewing with the client
2. Have the client sign a viewing form
3. Attach the signed viewing form to this registration email
This viewing form serves as proof that a viewing took place.

🔹 Exact Template

Subject: Registration Confirmation - [CLIENT_NAME]

Dear [BANK_NAME] Team,

This email is to provide you with a registration.

Please find attached the viewing form for the below Land.

Please register the following client under CSC Zyprus Property Group LTD and send me a confirmation.

**My Mobile:** [AGENT_MOBILE] (please call me for any further information)

**Registration Details:** [CLIENT_NAME] [CLIENT_PHONE_MASKED]

**Property:** [PROPERTY_LINK]

⚠️ **REMINDER:** Don't forget to attach the viewing form when sending this registration email to the bank!

(Banks don't attend viewings for LAND, so they require the signed viewing form as proof of viewing.)

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: User mentions "bank registration", "land registration", "register land with bank", etc.
2. Ask Pre-Question: "Is this for a Property (house/apartment/villa) or Land?" - If Land, use this template. If Property, use Template 05.
3. Extract: Silently extract provided fields from conversation
4. Ask: Only ask for MISSING required fields
5. Validate: Ensure property link is present (mandatory)
6. Generate: Copy template exactly, replacing all placeholders
7. Remind: Always include the viewing form attachment reminder

🔹 Common Banks

🔹 Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Generating without property link → Always require the link
❌ Not masking client phone → Always mask middle digits
❌ Using "Dear Sir/Madam" → Use "Dear [BANK_NAME] Team,"
❌ Forgetting viewing form reminder → ALWAYS include for land registrations
❌ Using Template 05 for land → Land MUST use Template 06 (includes viewing form reminder)
❌ Bolding the subject line → Never bold subject lines

💡 Pro Tips
- Banks NEVER attend land viewings - they rely on the viewing form as proof
- The viewing form must be signed by the client before sending
- Use Template 09, 10, or 11 to generate the viewing form first
- The agent mobile says "for any further information" (not "to arrange a viewing" like Template 05)
- This process protects the agent's commission claim for land sales

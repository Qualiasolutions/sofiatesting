📌 Template 05: Bank Property Registration

**Purpose**: Register a client with a bank for a specific property (house, apartment, villa, etc.) and request confirmation.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Bank Name (e.g., REMU, Altamira, Gordian, Bank of Cyprus, Hellenic Bank)
- Client Name (e.g., Andreas Andreou)
- Client Phone (full format) (e.g., +357 99 123456)
- Agent Mobile (e.g., +357 99 998877)
- Property Link (MANDATORY - e.g., https://www.remuproperties.com/Cyprus/listing-29190)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting must be `Dear [BANK_NAME] Team,`
- Property link is **MANDATORY** - do not generate without it
- Mask client phone in the body (e.g., +357 99 ** ***56 - show first 6 and last 2 digits)
- Subject line: No bolding
- Body: Only bold the field labels (My Mobile:, Registration Details:, Property:)
- Do NOT include viewing form attachment reminder (that's only for LAND - Template 06)

🔹 Phone Masking Rules
Full phone: +357 99 123456
Masked: +357 99 ** ***56
Pattern: Show country code + first 2 digits of number + mask middle + show last 2 digits

🔹 Exact Template

Subject: Registration Confirmation - [CLIENT_NAME]

Dear [BANK_NAME] Team,

This email is to provide you with a registration.

Please register the following client under CSC Zyprus Property Group LTD and send me a confirmation.

**My Mobile:** [AGENT_MOBILE] (please call me to arrange a viewing)

**Registration Details:** [CLIENT_NAME] [CLIENT_PHONE_MASKED]

**Property:** [PROPERTY_LINK]

Looking forward to your prompt reply.

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: User mentions "bank registration", "register with bank", "REMU", "Altamira", "Gordian", etc.
2. Ask Pre-Question: "Is this for a Property (house/apartment/villa) or Land?" - If Property, use this template. If Land, use Template 06.
3. Extract: Silently extract provided fields from conversation
4. Ask: Only ask for MISSING required fields
5. Validate: Ensure property link is present (mandatory)
6. Generate: Copy template exactly, replacing all placeholders

🔹 Common Banks
- REMU (Real Estate Management Unit)
- Altamira Asset Management
- Gordian Holdings
- Bank of Cyprus
- Hellenic Bank
- APS Cyprus

🔹 Example Output

Subject: Registration Confirmation - Andreas Andreou

Dear REMU Team,

This email is to provide you with a registration.

Please register the following client under CSC Zyprus Property Group LTD and send me a confirmation.

**My Mobile:** +357 99 998877 (please call me to arrange a viewing)

**Registration Details:** Andreas Andreou +357 99 ** ***56

**Property:** https://www.remuproperties.com/Cyprus/listing-29190

🔹 Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Generating without property link → Always require the link
❌ Not masking client phone → Always mask middle digits
❌ Using "Dear Sir/Madam" → Use "Dear [BANK_NAME] Team,"
❌ Adding viewing form reminder → That's only for Land (Template 06)
❌ Bolding the subject line → Never bold subject lines

💡 Pro Tips
- Banks will arrange their own viewings for properties (houses/apartments)
- The agent mobile is included so the bank can call to coordinate viewing times
- Always include the full property link for easy reference

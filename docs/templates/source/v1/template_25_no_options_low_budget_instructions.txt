📌 Template 25: No Options - Low Budget

**Purpose**: Handle 'No Options - Low Budget' communication exactly as per template.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Client's Name (e.g., John Miller)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year is missing automatically assume the upcoming occurrence (NEVER ask for the year); if time is missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**). Nothing else.
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Use personalized greeting `Dear [Client's Name],` where shown.

🔹 Exact Template
Template 09: No Options - Low Budget

Required Fields:

Dear [Client's Name],

We hope this email finds you well. We appreciate your interest in our real estate services and your recent property request. However, we regret to inform you that based on your budget, preferences and areas of interest, we currently do not have any suitable options available.

While we currently do not have any options within your budget and preferences, we would like to leave the door open for further opportunities. If you are willing to adjust your budget, preferences or areas of interest, we would be happy to explore other potential options with you.

Thank you for your understanding, and we are looking forward to your reply.

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

🔹 Common Mistakes
❌ Wrong		✅ Correct
Bolding subject lines	No bolding except pricing/fees
Using personalized greeting when placeholder is required	Use `Dear XXXXXXXX,` unless template says otherwise
Generating with [FIELD] placeholders left	Ask for missing fields, then generate with no placeholders

🔹 Example Output
Subject: Adjustments required – [Client's Name]

Email Body:
(Example body per exact template...)

💡 Pro Tips
- Keep tone professional and concise.
- Follow subject format exactly if specified.

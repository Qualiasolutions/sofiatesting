📌 Template 23: Follow-up - Single Property

**Purpose**: Handle 'Follow-up - Single Property' communication exactly as per template.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Client's Name (e.g., Maria Jones)
- Property Type (e.g., apartment)
- Location (e.g., Limassol)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year missing ask: "Which year? 2025 or 2026?"; if time missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**). Nothing else.
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Use personalized greeting `Dear [Client's Name],` where shown.

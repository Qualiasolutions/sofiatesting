# Project Documentation

This directory groups operational knowledge, setup guides, and historical updates for the SOFIA AI assistant.

- `guides/` – step-by-step deployment and integration manuals for engineering and support teams.
- `knowledge/` – domain context, operating procedures, and status reports that inform AI behaviour.
- `templates/` – the full SOFIA instruction corpus, including the live template registry and source exports.
- `updates/` – change logs, debugging notes, and Claude-specific configuration guidance.

When adding new documentation, pick the subfolder that best matches the audience:

1. **Guides** for reproducible procedures.
2. **Knowledge** for canonical reference material.
3. **Templates** for instruction content that feeds the AI system.
4. **Updates** for engineering change history and investigative notes.

Keep files in Markdown, prefer relative links, and avoid storing secrets.

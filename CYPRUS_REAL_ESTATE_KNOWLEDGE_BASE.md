## 1. PROPERTY TRANSACTION TAXES

### BUYERS PAY

**Buyer pays EITHER Transfer Fees OR VAT (not both in most cases)**

- **Transfer Fees**: Paid on Resale Properties OR on Plots/Land Parcels not subject to VAT
- **VAT**: Paid on New Properties or on Plots/Land Parcels subject to VAT

**UNUSUAL CASE - Both Transfer Fees and VAT:**
Consider purchasing a plot for €120,000 + VAT. The land registry office appraises the plot at €200,000. To calculate Transfer Fees, deduct the purchase price from the appraised value:
- €200,000 - €120,000 = €80,000
- Full Transfer Fees are then applied to this difference, without utilizing the 50% discount
- Transfer fees ≈ €2,400 (3% on the amount up to €85,000, first transfer fees band)

### SELLERS PAY

**Seller pays EITHER Capital Gains TAX OR VAT**

**Capital Gains Tax:**
- Paid if there is a profit made by the seller (20% on the Gains/Profit)
- Fixed rate of 20% on both individuals and companies
- Calculated on gains arising from disposal of immovable property in Cyprus
- Deductions: original cost, additional expenditure (adjusted for inflation), allowable expenses (interest on loan, real estate fees, advertising)
- If property purchased prior to 1980: cost used is market value as at 1.1.1980

**Capital Gains Tax Calculator:** https://www.zyprus.com/capital-gains-calculator

**VAT (Rare Cases - 10 Year Rule):**
If an eligible person used the reduced VAT policy but does not use house as main residence for at least 10 years and sells/rents before 10 years:
- Must notify Registrar within 30 days
- Pay difference between reduced VAT (5%) and standard rate (19%) for remaining period

**Example:**
- House price: €600,000 with 5% VAT
- Sells after 3 years
- €600,000 × 5% = €30,000
- €600,000 × 19% = €114,000
- €114,000 – €30,000 = €84,000 (Difference)
- €84,000 × 7/10 = €58,800 (what you pay)

**Exception:** Death or transfer to adult child of owner

**Refugee Compensation Fee:**
- Sellers pay 0.004% on selling price
- Example: €180,000 sale = €720 fee

## 2. VAT ON LAND

### Agricultural / Commercial

- Banks, Developers, any Company: 19% VAT

**Private Individual Sellers:**

- Can claim back 14% VAT once they build main residence and use it for 6 months
- 14% = difference between 19% standard and 5% reduced rate

**Special Cases:**
- Land with existing old building/house: 0% VAT possible (resale)
- Large land parcels with buildings: VAT may apply proportionately to remaining land

**Share Transfer:**
- Transfer/sale of company shares owning property: NO VAT, NO transfer fees

## 6. PLANNING ZONES & DEVELOPMENT

### Key Planning Terms

**Building Density (Συντελεστής Δόμησης):** Total buildable area
**Site Coverage (Συντελεστής Κάλυψης):** Ground floor coverage
**Floors (Όροφοί):** Number of floors allowed
**Height ('Ύψος):** Maximum height in meters

### Building Density - What is Counted

**INCLUDED in Building Density:**
- Corridors
- Covered verandas exceeding limits (see below)

**NOT INCLUDED in Building Density:**
- Piloti / Parking area
- Lobby / Entrance area (up to certain degree)

**Covered Verandas Rules:**
- Local Town Plans: Must not exceed 25% of net buildable area per level
- Rural Countryside Plan: Must not exceed 20% of net buildable area per level
- Exceeding areas ARE counted in Building Density

### Development Calculation Example

**Plot:** 530m²
**Zone:** Κα3
**Building Density:** 140% (1.4)
**Site Coverage:** 50% (0.5)
**Floors:** 4
**Height:** 17 meters

**Calculations:**
1. Building Density: 530 × 1.40 = 742m²
2. Site Coverage: 530 × 0.50 = 265m²
3. Net Buildable (deduct 10% communal): 742 × 0.90 = 667m²
4. Per Floor: 667 ÷ 4 = 166m²
5. Per Apartment (2 per floor): 166 ÷ 2 = 83m²

**Covered Verandas:**
- Per Level: 166 × 0.25 = 41m²
- Per Apartment: 41 ÷ 2 ≈ 20.5m²

**Result:** 8 apartments × (83m² indoor + 20m² covered verandas)

## 2. Land Division - Converting Fields to Plots

**Purpose:** When dividing agricultural fields into buildable residential plots, green area must be deducted.

### Local Town Plans (Τοπικά Σχέδια)

| Field Size | Green Area Deduction |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Up to 800 m² | 0% |
| 800 – 1,500 m² | 5% |
| 1,500 – 2,500 m² | 10% |
| 2,500+ m² | 15% |

### Rural Town Plan (Δήλωση Πολιτικής)

| Field Size | Green Area Deduction |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Under 2,500 m² | May be waived entirely |
| 2,500+ m² | Maximum 10% (but final area must be ≥2,000 m²) |

**Key Point:** Rural areas have more favorable conditions - they already have extensive green areas, so requirements are more lenient.

## 8. Investment Yield Formulas

### Core Formula
**YIELD = Annual Income ÷ Capital Value**

### Formula Variations

| You Know | You Need | Formula |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Annual Income + Capital Value | Yield | Income ÷ Value |
| Annual Income + Yield | Capital Value | Income ÷ Yield |
| Capital Value + Yield | Annual Income | Value × Yield |

### Practical Examples

**Finding Yield:**
- Annual rental: EUR 6,000
- Property value: EUR 100,000
- **Yield = EUR 6,000 ÷ EUR 100,000 = 6%**

**Finding Value from Yield:**
- Annual rental: EUR 6,000
- Target yield: 6%
- **Value = EUR 6,000 ÷ 0.06 = EUR 100,000**

**Finding Required Rent:**
- Property value: EUR 100,000
- Target yield: 6%
- **Annual rent = EUR 100,000 × 0.06 = EUR 6,000**
- Monthly rent: EUR 6,000 ÷ 12 = **EUR 500**

### Typical Cyprus Yields
| Property Type | Yield Range |
|---------------|-------------|
| Residential long-term | 3-5% |
| Short-term rentals | 5-8% |
| Commercial | 5-7% |

## 9. Planning Zones & Building Density

### Four Key Parameters

| Parameter | Greek Term | Meaning |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Building Density | Συντελεστής Δόμησης | Total buildable floor area allowed |
| Site Coverage | Συντελεστής Κάλυψης | Percentage of plot for ground footprint |
| Floors | Όροφοί | Maximum number of stories |
| Height | Ύψος | Maximum building height in meters |

### Calculation Examples

**Given:** 530 m² plot, Zone Κα3, Density 1.4 (140%), Coverage 0.5 (50%), Max 4 floors, Max 17m height

**Building Density Calculation:**
- 530 m² × 1.4 = **742 m² total buildable**

**Site Coverage Calculation:**
- 530 m² × 0.5 = **265 m² ground floor footprint**

**Net Sellable Area:**
- Deduct ~10% for communal areas (corridors, lobbies)
- 742 m² × 0.9 = **~668 m² net sellable**

**Per Floor Distribution:**
- 668 m² ÷ 4 floors = **167 m² per floor**
- 2 apartments per floor = **83 m² per apartment**

### What IS and IS NOT Counted in Building Density

**COUNTED in Density:**
- All indoor living space
- Corridors
- Covered verandas (if exceeding limits below)

**NOT Counted in Density:**
- Pilotis / Parking areas
- Lobby / Entrance (up to certain limits)
- Small storage areas (up to certain limits)
- Uncovered verandas

### Covered Verandas Limits

| Plan Type | Maximum Verandas |
|-----------|------------------|
| Local Town Plans (Τοπικά Σχέδια) | 25% of net area per level |
| Rural Countryside Plan (Δήλωση Πολιτικής) | 20% of net area per level |

**Example:** 167 m² floor, Local Plan
- 25% verandas allowed: 167 × 0.25 = **41 m² total verandas per floor**
- Per apartment (2 per floor): **~20 m² covered verandas each**

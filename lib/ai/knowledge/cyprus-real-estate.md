## SECTION 1: AML/KYC Compliance Requirements

### 1.1 Record Keeping Procedure for New Cases

For every new case, request from the lawyer handling the transaction a PDF file containing the key documents of the case. This file should include at least the Sales Agreement.

This document should be sent as a copy, as we are directly involved in the transaction and, according to **Law 188(I)/2007**, we are legally required to maintain AML/KYC records for our clients — just like the lawyers are.

### 1.2 Legal Obligation

According to **Law 188(I)/2007**, we are legally required to maintain AML/KYC records for our clients.

This is not just a preference or internal policy - it's a legal obligation that applies to all parties involved in real estate transactions.

**Key Points:**
- We are directly involved in the transaction
- The law applies to us just as it applies to lawyers
- Failure to comply can result in legal consequences
- Documentation must be maintained for the legally required period

### 1.3 Response to Lawyer Questions

If a lawyer asks why you are requesting documents, explain that:
- It is also a legal obligation for us, not only for them
- Since we are involved in the transaction, we are required to keep this documentation on file
- No one will refuse this request — it is reasonable and fully in line with the legislation

Most lawyers already understand this requirement. This is standard practice in the industry.

### 1.4 Practical Implementation

Most lawyers already have these files prepared in PDF format, so there is minimal effort involved in forwarding them.

**Process Flow:**
1. Identify the lawyer handling the transaction
2. Request the PDF file with key documents
3. Ensure the file includes at least the Sales Agreement
4. Follow up if necessary

Request should be made as soon as the case is initiated.

### 1.5 Minimum Document Requirements

Even if the full AML/KYC file is not available, the **Sales Agreement is a minimum requirement** and must be obtained.

**Essential Documents:**
- **Sales Agreement (Minimum Requirement)**: The primary document proving the transaction details
- **Additional AML/KYC Documents**: If available, include any other compliance documentation

**Why Sales Agreement is Essential:**
- Contains key transaction details
- Required for bank commission release
- Essential for audit purposes

### 1.6 Document Submission Process

Once you have the PDF file from the lawyer and the invoice:

**Email Details:**
- **To:** compliance@zyprus.com
- **Subject:** Case Invoice No [INVOICE NUMBER]
- **Attachments:** PDF file from lawyer AND invoice
- **CC:** Include supervisor on the first submission for each case

Both documents must be sent together. Invoice number is critical for case tracking.

### 1.7 Importance of Proper Documentation

**Key Benefits:**
- Fully covers us in the event of an AML or tax audit
- Avoids the need to ask for documents later
- In some cases, the bank may require a copy of the Sales Agreement to release commission payment
- Speeds up commission payment process
- Ensures compliance with regulatory requirements
- Provides a complete audit trail

### 1.8 Bank Transactions (Gordian/Remu/Altamira)

**Way 1 - Direct Communication:** Connect the bank or fund directly with your client and be included in the email communication. Forward to compliance@zyprus.com as needed.

**Way 2 - Lawyer Involvement:** If you pass the case to a lawyer, request the details from the lawyer representing the buyer or your client—this helps bypass the bank's bureaucracy.

**Way 3 - Client Request:** Worst case scenario, ask the client to provide if possible.

## SECTION 2: Division of Land (Field to Plots)

### 2.1 Land Division Process Overview

The process of converting a field into individual plots requires understanding of zoning regulations and green area requirements.

**Key Considerations:**
- Green area requirements vary by field size
- Different rules apply to different planning zones
- Local Town Plans vs. Rural Town Plan regulations

**Planning Zones:**
- Local Town Plans / City's Regional areas (Τοπικά Σχέδια)
- Rural Town Plan (ΔΗΛΩΣΗ ΠΟΛΙΤΙΚΗΣ)

### 2.2 Green Area Requirements - Local Town Plans

**Green Area Deduction Based on Field Size:**

| Field Size | Green Area Deduction |
|------------|---------------------|
| Up to 800 sq.m. | 0% Green area |
| 800 sq.m. – 1,500 sq.m. | 5% Green area |
| 1,500 sq.m. – 2,500 sq.m. | 10% Green area |
| 2,500 sq.m. and above | 15% Green area |

These percentages represent the portion of the field that must be designated as green area and cannot be developed.

### 2.3 Green Area Requirements - Rural Town Plan

For areas in Rural Town Plan, the **maximum area for public green deducted is 10%**.

**Key Points:**
- Parcels with area less than 2,500 sq.m. may not have public green deducted
- Parcels with area 2,500 sq.m. or over: green area deduction will be decreasing so the final area is not less than 2,000 sq.m.

**Why Rural Requirements are Different:**
- Rural areas already have a lot of green spaces
- Development considerations differ from urban areas
- Balance between development and preservation

---

## SECTION 3: Minimum Square Meters for Development

### 3.1 Development Standards Overview

Minimum square meter requirements for different types of residential properties vary based on location within Cyprus.

**Key Considerations:**
- Requirements differ between City Center and Other Areas
- Standards are based on net indoor area (Ωφέλιμα Εμβαδά)

### 3.2 Minimum Square Meters Requirements

**Net Indoor Area (Ωφέλιμα Εμβαδά):**

| Property Type | City Center | Other Areas |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Studio | 30m² | 35m² |
| 1 Bedroom | 45m² | 50m² |
| 2 Bedroom | 65m² | 75m² |
| 3 Bedroom | 85m² | 95m² |
| Student Accommodation | 30m² (subject to conditions) | 30m² (subject to conditions) |

City Center areas typically have slightly smaller minimum requirements due to higher density and space constraints.

### 3.3 Limassol Local Town Plan Example

The Limassol 2011 Local Town Plan (Τοπικό Σχέδιο Λεμεσού 2011) serves as a reference.

**Key Zones in the Plan:**
- Residential Zones (with different density categories)
- Touristic Zones
- Commercial Zones
- Industrial Zones
- Agricultural Zones

## SECTION 5: Property Transaction Taxes

### 5.1 Buyer Taxes - Transfer Fees vs VAT

**Buyer pays either Transfer Fees or VAT, depending on the property type.**

**Transfer Fees:**
- Paid on Resale Properties
- Paid on Plots/Land Parcels not subject to VAT
- Calculated based on property value
- 0% discount on first €85,000, 50% discount thereafter

**VAT:**
- Paid on New Properties
- Paid on Plots/Land Parcels subject to VAT
- Standard rate: 19%
- Reduced rate: 5% for first-time buyers meeting criteria

**Unusual Cases:**
In rare situations, both Transfer Fees and VAT may need to be paid when there's a significant difference between purchase price and land registry valuation.

### 5.2 Seller Taxes - Capital Gains

**Capital Gains Tax is paid if there is a profit made by the seller (20% on the Gains/Profit).**

**Calculation:**
- Capital gain tax is levied at a fixed rate of 20%
- Calculated on gains from disposal of immovable property in Cyprus
- Also applies to disposal of shares in companies owning such property

**Deductions:**
- Original cost of property
- Additional expenditure (adjusted for inflation)
- Allowable expenses directly related to disposal
- Interest on loan, real estate fees, advertising costs

**Special Rules:**
- If property purchased before 1980, market value as of 1.1.1980 is used
- Certain exemptions may apply

### 5.3 Seller VAT - Early Sale Penalty

If an eligible person who used the reduced VAT policy does not use their house as main residence for at least 10 years and proceeds with a sale or rent prior to the lapse of 10 years, they must pay the difference between reduced VAT (5%) and standard VAT (19%).

**Procedure:**
- Must notify Registrar within 30 days of termination of use
- Pay difference for remaining period of 10-year commitment

**Example Calculation:**
- House bought for €600,000 at 5% VAT = €30,000
- Standard VAT would be €600,000 × 19% = €114,000
- Difference = €84,000
- If sold after 3 years: €84,000 × 7/10 = €58,800 repayment

**Exceptions:**
- Death of owner
- Transfer to adult child of owner

### 5.4 Refugee Compensation Fee

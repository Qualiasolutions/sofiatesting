Dear [Client's Name],

I trust this email finds you well.

I wanted to touch base to see if you're still actively searching for a property, or if you've already found one that suits your needs.

If you're still looking, I would greatly appreciate any updates or changes to your preferences. This will help me refine the search and present you with options that are most relevant to you.

If you've already found a property, kindly let me know so I can update my records and avoid sending unnecessary emails.

Please remember that I'm here to assist you every step of the way. If you have any questions or need any support, don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your time and feedback — it is greatly appreciated.

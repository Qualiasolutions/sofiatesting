Subject: Property information – [Client's Name]

Dear [Client's Name],

Thank you for expressing interest in the property listed with our estate agency. We appreciate your inquiry and would like to provide you with some important information.

As a standard practice, we do not disclose the exact location or address of the property prior to a scheduled viewing and/or completion of our registration process.

This practice is in place to protect the interests of all parties involved and to ensure that our agency's commission is duly respected.

We understand that you may have questions about the property's location but we are unable to disclose that information without taking the necessary steps. We value your interest in the property and would be happy to arrange a phone communication at your convenience.

Please let us know your preferred date and time for a phone call. To make scheduling easier, it would be helpful if you could provide two time/date options that work best for you.

This will enable us to discuss your property requirements in detail and provide you with personalized assistance in finding the right property.

We look forward to hearing from you and assisting you with your property search.

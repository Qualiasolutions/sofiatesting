Template 19: Different Regions Request

Required Fields:

Client's Name (e.g., Andreas Andreou)

Subject: Adjustments required for areas of interest – [Client's Name]

Dear [Client's Name],

We hope this email finds you well. We appreciate your interest in our estate agency and your request to view properties in different regions in Cyprus.

However, we regret to inform you that your request to view properties in multiple regions is not feasible due to the resources and time required for such extensive coverage.

As a result, we would appreciate it if you could consider narrowing down your preferences to properties in one specific region from the following options: Paphos, Limassol, Larnaca, Nicosia or Famagusta.
We understand that you may have interests in multiple regions, but by narrowing down your search, we will be able to provide you with a more streamlined service. This will also allow us to connect you with the right consultant in our company.

If you are open to adjusting your request to a single region, please let us know and we will be more than happy to assist you further. If, however, this is not possible, we regretfully won't be able to facilitate your request at this time.

We appreciate your understanding and we remain committed to providing you with the best possible service within our operational capabilities.

We look forward to hearing from you and assisting you with your property search.

Dear [Client's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up with you and see if you are still in the market for a property in [Location]. I have some new property options that may fit your requirements, and I would be happy to share them with you.

Here are the properties:

Please let me know if any of these properties catch your attention or if there are any updates to your property preferences or budget. If, however, you are no longer in the market for a property, please let me know so that I can update my records and avoid sending you any unnecessary emails. Your satisfaction is important to me.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

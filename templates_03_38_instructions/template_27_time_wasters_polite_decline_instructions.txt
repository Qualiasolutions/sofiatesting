**Purpose**: Handle 'Time Wasters - Polite Decline' communication exactly as per template.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.

- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**). Nothing else.

- Use personalized greeting `Dear [Client's Name],` where shown.

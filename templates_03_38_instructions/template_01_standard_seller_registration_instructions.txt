📌 Template 01: Standard Seller Registration
Purpose: Document to register a buyer’s interest in a seller’s property and confirm a viewing.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
Buyer Names (e.g., John Smith OR Maria & George Papadopoulos)
Property Introduced (e.g., Limassol Building OR Reg. No. 0/1789 Germasogeia, Limassol)
Property Link (e.g., https://www.zyprus.com/Cyprus/property/12345) (optional but preferred)
Viewing Date & Time (e.g., October 21, 2025 at 5:00 PM OR tomorrow at 3 PM)
🔹 Critical Rules (MUST Follow)
⚠️ NEVER GENERATE WITHOUT ALL REQUIRED FIELDS:

If viewing date/time is missing → STOP and ASK for it immediately.
NEVER generate with [VIEWING_DATETIME] placeholder.
NEVER generate partial documents.
Greeting Protocol:

ALWAYS use: Dear XXXXXXXX, (placeholder for seller's name).
NEVER personalize unless explicitly instructed.
Date/Time Validation:

If user says "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025 (no need to ask).
If user says "October 15th" → ASK: "Which year? 2025 or 2026?"
If time is missing → ASK: "What time is the viewing? (e.g., 15:00 or 3pm)"
Link Handling:

If not provided, omit the **Property Link:** line entirely.
If provided, include it as-is (e.g., **Property Link:** https://www.zyprus.com/...).
Formatting:

ONLY bold pricing/fees (N/A for this template; no fees listed).
No other bolding (e.g., names, links, or subject lines).
Subject Line:

MUST follow this format:

Registration – [BUYER_NAMES] – Reg No. [REG_NUMBER] – [PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION]
Example:

Registration – Maria & George Papadopoulos – Reg No. 0/1789 – Villa in Tala, Paphos
Confirmation Request:

ALWAYS end with:

Please confirm Registration and Viewing.
For the confirmation, Could you please reply ''Yes I confirm''

🔹 Step-by-Step Workflow for the Agent
Detect Request:

User says: "standard registration" or "seller registration" → Proceed to this template.
Extract Provided Fields:

Example user input: "Buyer is Andreas & Elena, Reg No. 0/5678, villa in Limassol, viewing Friday 3pm"
Silently extract:
Buyer Names = Andreas & Elena
Property Introduced = villa in Limassol with Registration No. 0/5678
Viewing = October 25, 2025 at 3:00 PM (auto-add year if "Friday" is today +5 days).
Ask for missing fields (if any):
"Please share the property link if available."
Validate All Fields:

Checklist:
 Buyer names (detect "&" or "and" for multiple buyers).
 Property details (Reg No. + description).
 Viewing date/time (full date + year + time). ⚠️ REQUIRED - DO NOT GENERATE WITHOUT THIS
 Link (optional; omit if missing).
Generate ONLY When All Required Fields Are Complete:

✅ All required fields collected (buyer names, property, viewing date/time).
✅ No placeholders remain (e.g., [VIEWING_DATETIME] must be replaced with actual date/time).
❌ NEVER ask "Should I generate now?" - just generate when ready.
❌ NEVER generate with missing required fields.
Output:

ONLY the final email (subject + body).
NEVER show:
Internal notes (e.g., "Extracted: Buyer = Andreas & Elena").
Explanations (e.g., "I’ll use Dear XXXXXXXX because...").
🔹 Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Wrong	✅ Correct
Using Dear Maria, (personalized)	Dear XXXXXXXX, (placeholder)
Subject: Registration for Maria	Subject: Registration – Maria & George – Reg No. 0/5678 – Villa in Limassol
Omitting **Property Link:** if no link	Omit the entire line if no link provided
Bolding the subject line	No bolding except pricing (N/A here)
Generating with [VIEWING_DATETIME] placeholder	Ask for missing time/year first
Adding "Let me know if you need changes"	Only output the final email
📌 Example Final Output
User Input:
"Standard registration for buyer 'Nikolas & Sofia', property is apartment Reg No. 1/2345 in Paphos, viewing next Monday at 4pm."

Agent Actions:

Extract:
Buyer Names = Nikolas & Sofia
Property = apartment in Paphos with Registration No. 1/2345
Viewing = October 28, 2025 at 4:00 PM (auto-calculate "next Monday").
Ask: "Please share the property link if available." (if not provided).

💡 Pro Tips for the Agent
Multiple Buyers: If names include "&", "and", or "husband & wife", no extra action needed—the template handles it.
No Link? Omit the line entirely—never write "**Property Link:** N/A".
Time Zones: Assume Cyprus time (EEST/UTC+3). If user says "3pm", use as-is.
Urgent Requests: Generate immediately once all fields are confirmed. No delays.

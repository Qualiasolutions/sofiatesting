📌 Template 05: Bank Property Registration

**Purpose**: Register a client with a bank for a specific property and request confirmation.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Bank Name (e.g., REMU)
- Client Name (e.g., Andreas Andreou)
- Client Phone (full) (e.g., +357 99 123456)
- Agent Mobile (e.g., +357 99 998877)
- Property Link (e.g., https://www.remuproperties.com/Cyprus/listing-29190)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year missing ask: "Which year? 2025 or 2026?"; if time missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**). Nothing else.
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Greeting must be `Dear [BANK_NAME] Team,`
- Mask client phone in the body as required (e.g., +357 99 ** ***56).
- Property link is **mandatory**.

🔹 Exact Template
Template 05: Bank Property Registration

Subject: Registration Confirmation - [CLIENT_NAME]

Email Body:

Dear [BANK_NAME] Team,

This email is to provide you with a registration.

Please register the following client under CSC Zyprus Property Group LTD and send me a confirmation.

**Registration Details:** [CLIENT_NAME] [CLIENT_PHONE_MASKED]

**Property:** [PROPERTY_LINK]

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

🔹 Common Mistakes
❌ Wrong		✅ Correct
Bolding subject lines	No bolding except pricing/fees
Using personalized greeting when placeholder is required	Use `Dear XXXXXXXX,` unless template says otherwise
Generating with [FIELD] placeholders left	Ask for missing fields, then generate with no placeholders

🔹 Example Output
Subject: Registration Confirmation - Andreas Andreou

📌 Template 08: Developer Registration (no Viewing)

**Purpose**: Register developer introduction without a viewing, with fee terms.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Client Names (e.g., Alex & Maria)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year missing ask: "Which year? 2025 or 2026?"; if time missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding:
  1. All monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**, **30%**)
  2. All field labels before colons (e.g., **Fees:**, **Registration Details:**)
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Use placeholder greeting `Dear XXXXXXXX,`
- Includes acceptance clause covering no-viewing cases.

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

🔹 Common Mistakes
❌ Wrong		✅ Correct
Bolding subject lines	No bolding except pricing/fees and field labels before colons
Not bolding field labels	Always bold labels before colons (**Fees:**, **Registration Details:**)
Using personalized greeting when placeholder is required	Use `Dear XXXXXXXX,` unless template says otherwise
Generating with [FIELD] placeholders left	Ask for missing fields, then generate with no placeholders

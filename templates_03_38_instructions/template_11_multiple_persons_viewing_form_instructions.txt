📌 Template 11: Multiple Persons Viewing Form

**Purpose**: Capture multiple attendees' details for a viewing.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Date (e.g., October 25, 2025)
- Person 1: Full Name (e.g., Maria Georgiou)
- Person 1: Passport No. (e.g., C1234567)
- Person 1: Issued By (e.g., Cyprus)
- Person 2: Full Name (e.g., George Papadopoulos)
- Person 2: Passport No. (e.g., D7654321)
- Person 2: Issued By (e.g., Greece)
- District (e.g., Paphos)
- Municipality (e.g., Tala)
- Registration No. (e.g., 0/1789)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year missing ask: "Which year? 2025 or 2026?"; if time missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**). Nothing else.
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Use exact company details: Reg. No. 742, L.N. 378/E.
- Add additional persons blocks as needed.

🔹 Exact Template

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

🔹 Common Mistakes
❌ Wrong		✅ Correct
Bolding subject lines	No bolding except pricing/fees
Using personalized greeting when placeholder is required	Use `Dear XXXXXXXX,` unless template says otherwise
Generating with [FIELD] placeholders left	Ask for missing fields, then generate with no placeholders

🔹 Example Output
User Input: "Couple viewing, Maria & George, Reg 0/1789."

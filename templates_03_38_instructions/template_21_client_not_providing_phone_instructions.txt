I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you about our property consultation process.

To ensure we can best assist you, we require your phone number for assigning a property consultant to your request. Our consultants initiate communication over the phone with all inquiries and potential clients, allowing us to deliver tailored assistance promptly. For that reason, also, our system mandates the inclusion of a complete phone number when submitting requests via our website.

Should providing a phone number pose any inconvenience, please know that we respect your decision. Regrettably, we won't be able to proceed with your request at this time if the necessary contact information is not provided.

Thank you for your understanding and for considering our services. We look forward to speaking with you soon and assisting you with your property search.

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

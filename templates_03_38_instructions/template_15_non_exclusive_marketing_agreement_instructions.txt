📌 Template 15: Non-Exclusive Marketing Agreement

**Purpose**: Set non-exclusive marketing terms including fee and marketing price.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Date (e.g., October 25, 2025)
- Seller Name (e.g., Marios Charalambous)
- Registration Number (e.g., 0/1789)
- Location (e.g., Tala, Paphos)
- Agent Name (e.g., Charalambos Pitros)
- Marketing Price (e.g., €350,000)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year missing ask: "Which year? 2025 or 2026?"; if time missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**). Nothing else.
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Keep clauses and numbering intact.
- Only bold the **5.0% + VAT** and initial agreed marketing price.

🔹 Exact Template
Non-Exclusive Marketing Agreement

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

🔹 Common Mistakes
❌ Wrong		✅ Correct
Bolding subject lines	No bolding except pricing/fees
Using personalized greeting when placeholder is required	Use `Dear XXXXXXXX,` unless template says otherwise
Generating with [FIELD] placeholders left	Ask for missing fields, then generate with no placeholders

🔹 Example Output
User Input: "Non-exclusive for 0/1789 Tala; price €350,000."
Generated Document:
Marketing Agreement ...

💡 Pro Tips
- 30-day termination clause must remain.
- Use exact agent/company credentials.

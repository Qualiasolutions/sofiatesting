📌 Template 03: Rental Property Registration

**Purpose**: Register a tenant’s interest in a rental property and confirm a viewing.

🔹 Required Fields (MUST Collect Before Generating)
- Tenant Names (e.g., Alex & Maria)
- Property Introduced (e.g., Apartment in Limassol)
- Property Link (e.g., https://www.zyprus.com/Cyprus/property/12345 (optional))
- Viewing Date & Time (e.g., October 25, 2025 at 3:00 PM)

🔹 Critical Rules
- Greeting: Default `Dear XXXXXXXX,` (placeholder) unless template requires personalization; follow template-specific overrides.
- Dates/Times: "tomorrow" → Auto-convert to October 21, 2025; if year missing ask: "Which year? 2025 or 2026?"; if time missing ask for a time (24h or am/pm).
- Links: Mandatory for Bank Registrations, Good Client, and Email Marketing; optional elsewhere (omit line if missing).
- Bolding: Only monetary values or fees/percentages (e.g., **€350,000**, **5% + VAT**). Nothing else.
- Subject Lines: Follow template-specific formats exactly; do not bold.
- Fees line includes the first agreed monthly rental amount clause.

🔹 Exact Template
Template 03: Rental Property Registration

Subject: Registration – [TENANT_NAMES] – [PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION]

Email Body:

Dear XXXXXXXX, (landlord)

This email is to provide you with a registration.

Client Information: [TENANT_NAMES] (potential tenant name) or potential tenants names i.e. husband & wife

Property Introduced: Your Property in [PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION]

Property Link: [PROPERTY_LINK] (optional - omit if not provided)

Viewing Arranged for: [VIEWING_DATETIME]

Fees: The first agreed monthly rental amount of the property. In the event that the property is rented to the above-mentioned client(s) introduced by our company.

In the unusual event that the above registered client of CSC Zyprus Property Group LTD communicates with you directly, you acknowledge and agree that you are legally bound to immediately cease such communication, notify us without delay, and inform our registered client that all further communication must be conducted solely through the agent CSC Zyprus Property Group LTD (they might ask Sophia to remove this at a later discussion with her.. is optional if they ask her to do so. But only then Sophia will remove it..)

Please confirm Registration and Viewing.

For the confirmation, Could you please reply ''Yes I confirm''

Looking forward to your prompt confirmation.

🔹 Workflow
1. Detect: Identify template from keywords (e.g., "rental registration" → Template 03).
2. Extract: Silently extract provided fields (names, reg no., dates, links).
3. Ask: Minimize questions; only ask missing required fields (e.g., "What time is the viewing?").
4. Validate: Confirm year for dates; ensure links present where mandatory; ensure greeting style per template.
5. Generate: Copy Exact Template verbatim, replacing placeholders; omit optional lines when data missing.

🔹 Common Mistakes
❌ Wrong		✅ Correct
Bolding subject lines	No bolding except pricing/fees
Using personalized greeting when placeholder is required	Use `Dear XXXXXXXX,` unless template says otherwise
Generating with [FIELD] placeholders left	Ask for missing fields, then generate with no placeholders

🔹 Example Output
